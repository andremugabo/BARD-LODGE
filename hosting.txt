Hosting a PHP web-based system for free typically involves using free hosting services. Several platforms offer free hosting plans with support for PHP and MySQL. Here are some steps you can follow:

1. **Choose a Free Hosting Provider:**
   - Popular free hosting providers include:
     - [000webhost](https://www.000webhost.com/)
     - [InfinityFree](https://infinityfree.net/)
     - [AwardSpace](https://www.awardspace.com/)
     - [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) (Offers a free tier with limitations)

2. **Create an Account:**
   - Sign up for an account on the chosen free hosting provider's website.

3. **Access the Control Panel:**
   - After creating an account, you'll typically have access to a control panel or dashboard. Look for options to create a new website or upload your files.

4. **Upload Your PHP Files:**
   - Use the provided file manager or FTP (File Transfer Protocol) to upload your PHP files to the server. You may need to zip your files before uploading, and some platforms also allow you to upload files directly.

5. **Set Up a Database (if needed):**
   - If your PHP system uses a database, check if the hosting provider supports databases (usually MySQL). Create a new database and user, and configure your PHP application to use these credentials.

6. **Configure Domain (if available):**
   - Some free hosting providers offer subdomains or allow you to use your own domain. Follow the instructions provided by the hosting platform to set up or link a domain.

7. **Testing:**
   - Once your files are uploaded, visit the provided URL (subdomain or domain) to test your PHP application.

8. **Considerations:**
   - Free hosting plans often come with limitations, such as bandwidth, storage, and sometimes restrictions on the type of content or scripts allowed.
   - Be aware of any terms of service or limitations imposed by the free hosting provider.

Remember that while free hosting is a great option for testing and small projects, it may not be suitable for large-scale applications or those with high traffic. Additionally, free hosting services may display ads on your site as a way to cover their costs. If you're planning to host a more significant project or business application, you might want to consider paid hosting options for better performance, support, and features.
